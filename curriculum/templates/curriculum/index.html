    <h1 class="align-center">We are building an online library of curricula to enrich middle school computer science classes.</h1>
    <p class="align-center">FirstByte strives to equip educators with the resources to teach students engineering and computer science. By
        building a database of unique curricula and strong resources, teachers will find it easier to teach new lessons
        that work for their classrooms.</p>
